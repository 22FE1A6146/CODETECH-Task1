# Objective

The objective of this project is to preprocess raw data effectively, enabling AI models to deliver accurate and reliable predictions by ensuring the data is clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis.

# Key Activities

### Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values by replacing or removing them.
- Removing inconsistencies and duplicates from the dataset.

### Data Transformation
- Encoding categorical variables into numeric format.
- Standardizing numerical features to bring them to a common scale.

### Data Splitting
- Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

# Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy**: Utilized for numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: Employed for encoding, scaling, and splitting data.

# Key Insights

### Enhanced Data Quality
- The preprocessing pipeline ensures the dataset is free from missing values and inconsistencies.

### Data Readiness
- Preprocessed data is structured and ready for use in AI model training and evaluation.

### Consistent Features
- Standardization and encoding ensure uniformity across all features in the dataset.

# Usage

1. **Load Dataset**:
   - Import the raw dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Clean Data**:
   - Handle missing values and remove duplicates.

3. **Transform Data**:
   - Encode categorical variables and standardize numerical features.

4. **Split Data**:
   - Divide the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Output**:
   - A cleaned, transformed, and split dataset ready for use in AI models.
